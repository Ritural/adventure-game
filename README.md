# Adventure Game

Adventure Game is RPG inspired by DnD in the same style as the original Pokemon games on GBA.

It uses a combination of React for the UI/HUD and HTML Canvas for the game itself.

## Tasks

* More map scenarios!
* More maps!
* A story... Once upon a time... (Could be tied into the ghost mode power as mentioned in ideas)
* Extract player out to it's own class
* Enemies! (Need things to hit)
* Procedural dungeon generation!!!!!!!!111!!
* LibNoise looks helpful for making natural terrain

## Ideas

* The player has a special power where they can move through impassable things, basically a ghost mode for a short period of time and distance which scales as they level up. If they get stuck in an impassable tile then perhaps they die and an icon is added to that tile so they can see it the next time they play.
